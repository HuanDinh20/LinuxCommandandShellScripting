Now, if you enter “pwd”, you can see that you are indeed in your Documents folder.

If you want to get to your home folder directly, without having to explore to get there, then you can simply use the “tilda” symbol. And you are now in your home folder. Tilda represents your absolute path to home. Finally, you can provide a full path to a directory. Here, you are referring to the absolute pathname for the Notes directory from where you started your journey. And as expected, you are now back where you started, in your Notes directory.\n",
