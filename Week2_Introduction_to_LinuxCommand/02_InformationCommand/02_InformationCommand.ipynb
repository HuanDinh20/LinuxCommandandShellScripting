If you enter ”echo” you are basically saying “print nothing” so you just get a newline. If you would like to echo a single word without whitespace, such as “hello” you can just type “echo hello”. But if your string contains spaces, you need to use quotes. Then echo returns the quoted contents “Learning Linux is fun!” Finally, you can view the value of a variable, such as “PATH” by typing a dollar sign followed by the variable name, here we view each path of our system’s PATH variable, delimited by colons.\n",
